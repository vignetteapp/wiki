# Welcome to the Vignette wiki!

This is the place that stores the cumulative knowledge of the Vignette community. 

To get started, you can go on the [Installation Guide](install/prerequisites.md).

Or, if you are looking for a specific page, you can use the sidebar instead.
Currently WIP.

If you would like to contribute, please consult our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/vignetteapp/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Note: Vignette is currently in technical preview, so a lot of the features that you would expect from a full release aren't ready yet.
